remove gauge M1271 no data within 04-2014 to 08-2015
How many valid gauge measurements within study period to accept a gauge?
Check timestamps are all correctly centred and identical for all products and time resolutions, time zones
What does IMERG timestamp represent, in TMPA, it’s centre of window… check tech docu
Average out gauge records within same 0.1 GPM/ 0.25 TMPA cells
Currently v high FAR, low POD at 0.1/ hrly GPM
In detection stats w/ moving threshold, check how to deal with thresholds above max val, e.g. to avoid high no. of FAR
